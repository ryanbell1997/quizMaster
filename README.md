# quizMaster
This is a recreational full stack project that I am working on which is made up of a React front end, Python Flask back end, and a MongoDB database. 

The idea is that the user can create a quiz, (in future hoping to include more medias as ooposed to just text questions and answers) which then is submitted and stored to the server.

The users friends can then pull their quiz with the use of a unique quiz Id and then complete the quiz. It may be possible also to create a score board bound to that quiz.
